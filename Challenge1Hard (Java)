 * From website: Challenge 1 (Hard)
 * we all know the classic "guessing game" with higher or lower prompts.
 * lets do a role reversal; you create a program that will guess numbers between 1-100, and respond appropriately based on whether users say that the number is too high or too low.
 * Try to make a program that can guess your number based on user input and great code!
